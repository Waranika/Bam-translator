# Bam-translator

## Introduction

Bam-translator is a student project aimed at developing a translator specifically tailored for Western African languages. The project initially focuses on supporting languages from the Bamana family, leveraging techniques and resources from [Kasa](https://github.com/GhanaNLP/kasa), a platform for African language processing.

## The objective of this project

The objectives of this project are:

- [ ] develop a model for translating between several African languages and European languages
- [ ] to be able to make text-to-speech and speech-to-text in these languages

## Features

The Bam-translator project includes the following features:

- Translation capabilities between English and languages from the Bamana family.
- Implementation of transformer-based models for translation tasks.
- Modular design facilitating the easy addition of support for additional languages.

## Benefits

The development and deployment of a translator for Western African languages offer several advantages:

- **Improved Communication:** The translator enhances communication and understanding between speakers of English and Western African languages, fostering collaboration, knowledge exchange, and cultural appreciation.
- **Access to Information:** It enables speakers of Western African languages to access information and resources available in English, breaking down language barriers and promoting inclusivity.
- **Empowerment of Communities:** By offering translation tools tailored to their linguistic needs, the project empowers communities to engage more effectively in various domains, including education, healthcare, and governance.
- **Technological Advancement:** The development of such a translator showcases advancements in natural language processing (NLP) technology and demonstrates its applicability to underrepresented languages and regions.

## Getting Started

To begin using the translator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/west-african-translator.git
   cd west-african-translator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed. Detailed instructions can be found in the project's documentation.

3. **Run the Flask Application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the Translator Interface:**  
   Open a web browser and navigate to **http://localhost:5000** to access the translator interface.

## Usage

Most African languages have their own alphabets in Latin based on the phonetic alphabet, for example the Bambara alphabet is :
